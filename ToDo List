--- Current toDos --- (Sort by priority)
UI:
- Change the threshold to suit the new input voltage magnitude 3.2V

Peak detector & low pass
- Implement peak detector and LPF to get the envelope of the signal

Sensor
1. Learn exactly how to use those sensor, so that we can reiterate our previous calculations.

Filter & amp
- Test with noises added (drift and powerline)
- Build and validate the circuit in real life
    2a. The UI design and the sensor output may affect the desired gain


Integrate
- Test the full circuit with signal and noise(drift and power line)
- Change design description to include only left / right
- Think about the logic of combining the signals
    2a. Needs validation on sensor first


--- Storage of toDos below ---

Calibration
1. Determine which resistor to be replaced by adjustable resistor to fine tune gain and thresholds

Validation
1. Make the validation program with unity or matlab
2. Measure size of my screen and calculate the required distance during tests

--- Potential toDos ---

Fancy stuffs
1. Alert when gaze angle threshold crossing
