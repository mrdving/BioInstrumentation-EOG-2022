--- Current toDos --- (Sort by priority)
Consultation:
- how to use sensor
- why gain is lower than simulation?

UI:
- Change the threshold to suit the new input voltage magnitude 1.5V

Peak detector & low pass
- Implement peak detector and LPF to get the envelope of the signal
- Detect threshold crossing and hold the signal for a certain amount of time

Sensor
1. Learn exactly how to use those sensor, so that we can reiterate our previous calculations.


Integrate
- Test the full circuit with signal and noise(drift and power line)
- Change design description to include only left / right
- Change design description to detect changes of EOG instead of directly showing the gaze angle

--- Storage of toDos below ---

Calibration
1. Determine which resistor to be replaced by adjustable resistor to fine tune gain and thresholds

Validation
1. Make the validation program with unity or matlab
2. Measure size of my screen and calculate the required distance during tests
