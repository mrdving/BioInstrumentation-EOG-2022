--- Current toDos --- (Sort by priority)

Sensor
1. Learn exactly how to use those sensor, so that we can reiterate our previous calculations.

Filter & amp
1. Update output to 5V
2. Check capacitors. I have to know if the circuit is feasable
3. Build and validate the circuit in real life
    2a. The UI design and the sensor output may affect the desired gain

Integrate
1. Change design description to include only left / right
2. Think about the logic of combining the signals
    2a. Needs validation on sensor first


--- Storage of toDos below ---

Calibration
1. Determine which resistor to be replaced by adjustable resistor to fine tune gain and thresholds

Validation
1. Make the validation program with unity or matlab
2. Measure size of my screen and calculate the required distance during tests

--- Potential toDos ---

Fancy stuffs
1. Alert when gaze angle threshold crossing
