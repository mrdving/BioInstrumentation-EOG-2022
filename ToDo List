Filter & amp
1. Check capacitors I have to know if the circuit is feasable
2. Build and validate the circuit in real life

Integrate
1. Determine the expected signal when eyes looking up/down/left/right
2. Think about what to do since EOG pads only come in 1 pair, (maybe just left/right)
3. Think about the logic of combining the signals

Calibration
1. Adjust gain at feedback or input

UI
1. Determine led shining voltage range
2. Find ways to show the gaze angle using the linearity btw gaze angle and signal voltage

Validation
1. Make the validation program with unity or matlab
2. Measure size of my screen and calculate the required distance during tests

Fancy stuffs
1. Alert when gaze angle threshold crossing
