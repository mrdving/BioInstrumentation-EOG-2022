--- Current toDos --- (Sort by priority)
Consultation:
- how to use sensor
- why gain is lower than simulation?
- why ui threshold+ have a wierd shape?

Validation:
- Document the validation
- point out what is still unsatisfactory with the results (e.g. thresh, flicker)

Sensor
1. Learn exactly how to use those sensor, so that we can reiterate our previous calculations.

Design report
- Change design description to include only left / right
- Change design description to detect changes of EOG instead of directly showing the gaze angle

Calibration
-. Determine which resistor to be replaced by adjustable resistor to fine tune gain and thresholds

Validation
1. Make the validation program with unity or matlab
2. Measure size of my screen and calculate the required distance during tests
