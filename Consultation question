- Why is my gain lower than the simulation?
(refer to document "filter amp", May 10th & May 17th)
The total gain is around 500 instead of the designated 1000.
What is causing the difference?
A:
    May be a compound of unideal components. Test with multimeters may tell.

- Why is my peak detector having a temporal response only in the positive side?
(refer to "LED_Interface", May 16th)
A :
    It's a difference in LED's on/off.
    Tested and confirmed. The temporal response occurs when LED is turning on.

- How to use the eog sensor?
(refer to document "filter amp", May 10th, or "Sensor", May 10th)
The eog signal did not show any difference to the gaze angle.
Did I connected it wrong, or did I overlooked something else?
A:
    Well, still no idea. What I got was definitely pure noise.
    Could be that the vertical electrodes will have less difference than horizontal setups.
    Could be something wrong with the audio jack.
    Nevertheless, I'll just move on for now.
