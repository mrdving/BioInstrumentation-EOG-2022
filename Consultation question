- Why is my gain lower than the simulation?
(refer to document "filter amp", May 10th)
The total gain is around 500 instead of the designated 1000.
What is causing the difference?

- How to use the eog sensor?
(refer to document "filter amp", May 10th, or "Sensor", May 10th)
The eog signal did not show any difference to the gaze angle.
Did I connected it wrong, or did I overlooked something else?
